# Tais-Portfolio

### Hi There
I'm Tai and I'm from Los Angeles. I am just starting to learn web development. I really enjoy learning HTML CSS JS right now, and looking forward to learn more languages in the future. I've heard really good things about React and Python. 

In this repository I got some examples from 
* [YOUTUBE](youtube.com)
* [GOOGLE](google.com)
* [W3SCHOOL](w3school.com)
* [STACKOVERFLOW](stackoverflow.com)
